This report documents the current state of and latest work done towards an evolving multidisciplinary project that has been passed down through more than 10 years of students within the Cambridge University Engineering Department. The core theme of this ongoing work is to produce a self-balancing rider-less unicycle.

In this iteration of the work, the focus is on a smaller unicycle, and producing a controller capable of balancing it via a machine-learning route, rather than by forming a detailed model and applying control theory. This involves applying a technique known as \textsc{Pilco}, for which a Matlab toolbox exists, maintained by the department.
