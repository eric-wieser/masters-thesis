\section{Mechanical}

	The robot frame is made out of CNC-cut copper-coated fibreglass, known more commonly for its use in prototyping circuitry.
	This has the advantage of being light yet stiff, and immune to plastic deformation.

	Two MAXON motors\cite{motor} are attached to the robot, each with a corresponding 14:1 gearbox\cite{gearbox} and 512 count-per-revolution encoder\cite{encoder}.
	The first motor is connected via a timing belt with a 40:16 ratio to the drive wheel, while the second motor is directly attached to a steel flywheel (henceforth referred to as the \enquote{turntable}).

	To prevent damage to the turntable motor shaft, the chassis of the robot shields the turntable from direct impact, reinforced wtih some metal bolts.
	Atop this shielding, lies the control board on the front side of the robot, and the battery duct-taped to the rear.

	Previous work concluded \cite[p.~54]{aleksi} that a better simulation model of the unicycle was desirable, to help determine whether poor learning progress was due to implementation errors in software, or simply due to the small unicycle having a more challenging set of dynamics than the previously-simulated large unicycle.

	As part of my project, model parameters were found for the small unicycle, shown alongside the method used to obtain them in \cref{table:mechanical}.
	Noting that since one of the goals of PILCO is \emph{not} to require a detailed system model, some properties were simply estimated.

\section{Electrical design}

	Power comes from a \SI{7.4}{\volt}, \SI{1}{\ampere\hour}  LiPo battery, rated for discharging at up to \SI{30}{\ampere}.

	Controlling the robot is a ChipKIT Max32 microcontroller board. This and has a dual-use USB connection -- for programming the flash memory with new code, and as a USB serial connection, which allows data to be sent to and from the board.

	Atop the controller board sits a hand-soldered protoboard. This provided places to connect: a gyro and accelometer, via I2C; custom electronics to convert the quadrature encoder pulses into a single pulse train and a direction signal; and an external motor driver board, interfaced to PWM outputs.

	This project was inherited with no documentation on which physical pins were used for which external devices, so such a table was compiled and embedded in the source code. See \cref{TODO} for more details.
