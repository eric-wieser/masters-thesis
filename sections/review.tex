\section{Mechanical}

	The robot frame is made out of CNC-cut copper-coated fibreglass, known more commonly for its use in prototyping circuitry.
	This has the advantage of being light yet stiff, and immune to plastic deformation.

	Two MAXON motors\cite{motor} are attached to the robot, each with a corresponding 14:1 gearbox\cite{gearbox} and 512 count-per-revolution encoder\cite{encoder}.
	The first motor is connected via a timing belt with a 40:16 ratio to the drive wheel, while the second motor is directly attached to a steel flywheel (henceforth referred to as the \enquote{turntable}).

	To prevent damage to the turntable motor shaft, the chassis of the robot shields the turntable from direct impact, reinforced wtih some metal bolts.
	Atop this shielding, lies the control board on the front side of the robot, and the battery duct-taped to the rear.

	Previous work concluded \cite[p.~54]{aleksi} that a better simulation model of the unicycle was desirable, to help determine whether poor learning progress was due to implementation errors in software, or simply due to the small unicycle having a more challenging set of dynamics than the previously-simulated large unicycle.
	Noting that one of the goals of PILCO is \emph{not} to require a detailed system model, some properties were assumed using dimensional analyis.
