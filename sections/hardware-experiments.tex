	With all of the obvious problems corrected, it was finally time to apply the \textsc{Pilco} procedure.
	10 rollouts were performed under an affine controller with parameters
	\begin{align}
		\bm{b} &= \bm{0}, &
		W &=
			\frac{1}{\SI{15}{\degree}}
			\unitv{\psi}^T\unitv{\tau_w}
			+ \frac{1}{\SI{90}{\degree\per\second}}
			\unitv{\dot\phi}^T\unitv{\tau_t}\,,
	\end{align}
	and then $20$ rollouts were performed with learnt controllers.
	Performance (measured by time upright) is compared with that of the simulated robot in \cref{fig:learning-compare}.
	Unsurprisingly, it performs much better in early iterations, as we have already set it up with a plausible controller.
	Previous work~\cite{aleksi} concluded that this longer time upright was due to human reaction time in releasing the robot, but the work in \cref{sec:switch} makes this no longer relevant.
	Instead, this is likely due to a mismatch in the simulation model (\cref{table:mechanical}), especially since the parameters determining the rate of a fall from rest are the frame moments of inertia, which were estimated with the least accuracy.

	\subsection{Correcting the initial state}
	It was realized that after the improvements made in \cref{sec:acc:orient}, the initial state of the robot would no longer always be a vector of zeros. The symptom of this problem is shown in \todo{}.
	As such, it became necessary to compute a distribution of starts states.
	For simplicity, a Gaussian with a sparse diagonal covariance matrix is fitted to the data -- sparse because fitting a dense matrix would need far too many data points to not be degenerate. Future work could apply a relatively simple Bayesian learning approach here, in order to start with a prior.
