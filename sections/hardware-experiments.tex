	With all of the obvious problems corrected, it was finally time to apply the \textsc{Pilco} procedure.
	10 rollouts were performed under an affine controller with parameters
	\begin{align}
		\bm{b} &= \bm{0}, &
		W &=
			\frac{1}{\SI{15}{\degree}}
			\unitv{\psi}^T\unitv{\tau_w}
			+ \frac{1}{\SI{90}{\degree\per\second}}
			\unitv{\dot\phi}^T\unitv{\tau_t}\,,
	\end{align}
	and then $20$ rollouts were performed with learnt controllers.
